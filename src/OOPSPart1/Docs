1-> So there's a distinction here I want to point out, between an uninitialized variable, and
a variable with a null reference.An uninitialized variable, as we saw in the first instance,
causes a compile time error.But a variable with a null reference can be used in code, without
compiler errors, but will throw an exception at runtime.
e.g OOPSPart1.Car car;  ->compile time error
    OOPSPart1.Car car=null;  ->exception at runtime
